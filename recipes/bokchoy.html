        <p>Recipe for Stir Fried Bok Choy</p>
        <p>Bok choy is one of the many kinds of chinese cabbage and is highly resistant to cold weather. The name literally translates to white (bok) vegetable (choy).</p>

        <h2>Ingredients for a serving size of 4</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb baby bok choy (larger bok choy works too)</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>2tbsp corn oil</li>
            <li>0.50tsp salt</li>
            <li>0.50tsp sugar</li>
            <li>0.50tsp chicken bouillon(optional)</li>
            <br>
            <p>Note: baby bok choy is my preference but the larger varieties also work.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash bok choy</li><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Peel away the individual leafs and thoroughly wash as dirt gets trapped along the root.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Dry and cut the bok choy in half length wise.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a woke or pan and mince garlic.</li>
            <li>Cook garlic once oil starts to shimmer and add bok choy in a few seconds later.</li>
            <li>Add seasoning then plate. This is especially important with salt. Salt will cause the bok choy to immediately release moisture.</li>
        </ol>
